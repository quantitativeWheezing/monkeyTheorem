This code takes a text file and breaks it up into small fragments (e.g. 4 characters).
It then uses random number generation to randomly generate each fragment, demonstrating 
a simplified version of the Infinite Monkey Theorem

Tbh this is really an exercise in basic CUDA techniques, as well as an 
extension of sum reduction to include vectorized memory access

Parameters for the program can be changed in config.h according to the constraints 
described in that file

The text files included here can be generated by calling 
./build/bin/monkeyTheorem text

The code will generate the text of its own source and header files by calling
./build/bin/monkeyTheorem code

Lastly, one may generate a file in this folder by calling
./build/bin/monkeyTheorem <myFile>
